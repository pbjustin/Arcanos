# ARCANOS API Reference

> **Last Updated:** 2024-10-30 | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **OpenAI SDK:** v5.16.0

This guide summarises the HTTP API exposed by the Arcanos backend. All routes
are registered in [`src/routes/register.ts`](../../src/routes/register.ts).
Mutating endpoints require the `x-confirmed: yes` header unless the caller is a
trusted GPT (`TRUSTED_GPT_IDS` + `x-gpt-id`).

## üì° Core AI Endpoints

| Endpoint | Confirmation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /ask` | No | Primary chat endpoint routed through the Trinity brain. |
| `POST /brain` | Yes | Confirmation-gated alias for `/ask`. |
| `POST /arcanos` | Yes | Diagnostic orchestration entry point backed by `runARCANOS`. |
| `POST /siri` | Yes | Siri-style interface that reuses the Trinity pipeline. |
| `POST /arcanos-pipeline` | Yes | Multi-stage pipeline that combines ARCANOS, GPT‚Äë3.5, and GPT‚Äë5 reasoning. |
| `POST /api/arcanos/ask` | Yes | Minimal JSON API that returns or streams ARCANOS completions. |

### AI Utilities
- `POST /write`, `POST /guide`, `POST /audit`, `POST /sim`
  ‚Äì Content generation, guidance, auditing, and simulation helpers (all require
  confirmation).
- `POST /image`
  ‚Äì Image generation via OpenAI Images API (honours optional `size`).
- `POST /api/sim`
  ‚Äì Simulation API with supporting routes `GET /api/sim/health` and
  `GET /api/sim/examples`.
- `POST /gpt/:gptId/*`
  ‚Äì Dynamic router that forwards GPT-specific traffic to modules defined in
  `config/gptRouterConfig.ts`.

## ü©∫ Health & Diagnostics

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | Plain-text "ARCANOS is live" banner. |
| `GET /railway/healthcheck` | Railway-friendly health check. |
| `GET /health` | Aggregated health report including OpenAI and database status. |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness probe. |
| `GET /readyz` | Readiness probe (ensures required dependencies are available). |
| `GET /api/test` | Lightweight JSON probe used for smoke tests. |

## üîê Confirmation Gate Examples

Protected operations require either `x-confirmed: yes` or a trusted GPT ID.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/memory/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-confirmed: yes" \
  -d '{"key":"example","value":{"note":"stored by API"}}'
```

Requests from a trusted GPT can omit the confirmation header when both
`TRUSTED_GPT_IDS` and `x-gpt-id` are configured:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/memory/delete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-gpt-id: my-approved-gpt" \
  -d '{"key":"example"}'
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints return JSON payloads with `status`, `message`, and `timestamp`
fields (where applicable). Common failure modes include:

- `400 Bad Request` ‚Äì Validation errors, missing fields, or malformed JSON.
- `403 Forbidden` ‚Äì Missing confirmation header or untrusted GPT ID.
- `404 Not Found` ‚Äì Unknown worker/module identifiers.
- `429 Too Many Requests` ‚Äì Rate limits defined in `utils/security.ts` have been
  exceeded.
- `500 Internal Server Error` / `503 Service Unavailable` ‚Äì Upstream failures or
  external dependency outages.
