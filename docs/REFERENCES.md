# References

## Overview
Primary external references for OpenAI SDK usage, Railway operations, and project maintenance.

## Prerequisites
Use this alongside repository docs, not as a replacement.

## Setup
Start with repository-native docs in this order:
1. `README.md`
2. `RUN_LOCAL.md`
3. `CONFIGURATION.md`
4. `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Configuration
No additional configuration required for this document.

## Run locally
Use `RUN_LOCAL.md` for command sequences.

## Deploy (Railway)
Use `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for deployment and rollback procedures.

## Troubleshooting
If an external reference conflicts with repository behavior, prefer repository code and mark docs with `TODO` until resolved.
