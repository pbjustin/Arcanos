# Recent Optimizations

## Removed Bloat
- Deleted unused validation and purification scripts (`dead_code_scanner.py`, `demo-purification.cjs`).
- Removed redundant documentation files (`PURIFICATION_README.md`, `REFactorING.md`).
- Eliminated duplicate OpenAI client implementations.
- Cleaned up broken purification routes and services.

## Dependency Updates
- Upgraded to OpenAI SDK v5.16.0.
- Bumped ESLint to v9 with compatible TypeScript ESLint plugins.
- Removed deprecated dependencies throughout the workspace.

## Environment Variable Hygiene
- Removed hardcoded fine-tuned model IDs from all source files.
