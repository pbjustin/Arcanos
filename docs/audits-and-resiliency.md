# Audit and Fine-Tuned Model Resiliency Strategy

## Purpose
This document outlines how Arcanos employs audits to ensure compliance and operational excellence, and explains our resiliency backup plans for fine-tuned models. It includes clear, repeatable methods for conducting audits and activating model backups so that teams can respond effectively to incidents.

## Audit Program Overview
- **Scope**: Audits cover data pipelines, model training processes, deployment environments, and user-facing integrations.
- **Frequency**: Routine audits are scheduled quarterly, with additional ad-hoc reviews triggered by major releases or policy changes.
- **Governance**: The Compliance & Safety Guild owns the audit calendar, while domain leads provide evidence and remediation plans.

## Audit Method
1. **Preparation**
   - Review the quarterly risk register for prioritized systems.
   - Confirm audit objectives, success criteria, and required evidence.
   - Notify responsible teams and share the audit checklist at least two weeks in advance.
2. **Evidence Collection**
   - Pull configuration snapshots from infrastructure-as-code repositories.
   - Export relevant model training logs, data lineage reports, and evaluation dashboards.
   - Interview system owners to capture undocumented controls or recent changes.
3. **Validation**
   - Cross-check evidence against policy requirements (security, privacy, and fairness standards).
   - Reproduce a sample of deployment steps in the staging environment to validate procedural accuracy.
   - Run automated compliance scripts (see `arcanos_audit_config.json`) and record all findings.
4. **Reporting**
   - Compile findings into the standardized audit template.
   - Categorize issues by severity and map each to an owner and remediation deadline.
   - Present results at the weekly governance review and archive the report in the compliance drive.
5. **Follow-Up**
   - Track remediation tasks in the compliance dashboard.
   - Schedule verification checks to confirm fixes before closure.
   - Document lessons learned to refine the next audit cycle.

## Fine-Tuned Model Resiliency
We maintain resiliency measures to ensure fine-tuned models remain available and performant even during incidents.

### Backup Plan Components
- **Model Versioning**: All fine-tuned models are versioned with semantic tags and stored in the secure model registry.
- **Shadow Deployments**: A shadow instance of the previous stable model runs alongside the primary deployment for instant fallback.
- **Automated Health Checks**: Real-time metrics monitor latency, accuracy drift, and safety trigger rates. Alerts escalate to the on-call ML engineer.
- **Disaster Recovery Storage**: Encrypted backups of training data, fine-tuning configurations, and weights are replicated across regions.

### Backup Activation Method
1. **Incident Detection**
   - Receive automated alert or manual incident report indicating degraded model performance or availability.
   - Confirm the issue by reviewing monitoring dashboards and recent deployment changes.
2. **Triage and Decision**
   - Convene the incident response bridge.
   - Decide whether to roll back to the shadow model or trigger full redeployment based on severity and blast radius.
3. **Fallback Execution**
   - Use the deployment pipeline to promote the shadow model to primary traffic.
   - Update routing rules and clear caches to ensure consistent responses.
4. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Collect logs, compare recent training artifacts, and inspect feature store updates.
   - Document the timeline and contributing factors in the incident report.
5. **Recovery and Validation**
   - Once fixes are implemented, deploy the corrected fine-tuned model into a canary environment.
   - Run regression, fairness, and safety evaluations prior to full rollout.
   - Update the disaster recovery records with new artifacts and lessons learned.

## Clear Communication Method
To keep stakeholders aligned during audits and resiliency events:
1. **Notification Matrix**: Maintain a contact list for compliance leads, ML engineers, product owners, and executive sponsors.
2. **Status Updates**: Provide written updates every four hours during active incidents and within 24 hours of audit completion.
3. **Documentation**: Store all communications, decisions, and approvals in the compliance collaboration space for traceability.
4. **Post-Event Review**: Conduct a retrospective meeting within one week to confirm actions and update playbooks.

## Responsibilities Summary
- **Compliance & Safety Guild**: Owns audit framework, tracks remediation, and coordinates communication.
- **ML Engineering Team**: Maintains model registry, shadow deployments, and health monitoring.
- **SRE Team**: Ensures infrastructure resilience and disaster recovery replication.
- **Product & Policy Leads**: Validate user-facing impacts and ensure policy adherence.

By following these methods, Arcanos can consistently verify compliance, respond swiftly to incidents, and safeguard the reliability of our fine-tuned models.
