# Pass 2: Commit Proposal

## Title

Verify documentation structure compliance

## Body

### Why
Verify that all guide documents follow the standard structure as specified in the documentation audit plan.

### What
Reviewed all key guide documents to verify compliance with standard structure: Overview → Prerequisites → Setup → Configuration → Run locally → Deploy (Railway) → Troubleshooting → References.

### Evidence
- All key guide documents already follow the standard structure
- Non-guide documents (reference, index, policy) have appropriate alternative structures
- Standard structure is documented in `docs/README.md`

### Risk
**None** - Verification-only pass. No changes made.

### Files Changed
None - all files reviewed are already compliant.
