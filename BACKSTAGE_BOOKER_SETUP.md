## üìö Canon Management

### Understanding Canon Files

Canon files store the authoritative storyline information for your wrestling universe. They maintain:

- Character alignments and status
- Championship lineages
- Ongoing feuds and storylines
- Match results and consequences
- Brand-specific information

### Creating Canon Files

```bash
# Example: Creating a character file
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/canon/files/rhea_ripley.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "{
      \"name\": \"Rhea Ripley\",
      \"brand\": \"RAW\",
      \"alignment\": \"heel\",
      \"titles\": [\"Women's World Championship\"],
      \"currentFeud\": \"Bianca Belair\",
      \"status\": \"active\",
      \"lastUpdated\": \"2024-01-15\"
    }"
  }'
```

### Managing Storylines

```bash
# Example: Creating a storyline file
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/canon/files/womens_title_feud.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "{
      \"title\": \"Women's World Championship Feud\",
      \"participants\": [\"Rhea Ripley\", \"Bianca Belair\"],
      \"startDate\": \"2024-01-01\",
      \"plannedEndDate\": \"2024-04-07\",
      \"keyEvents\": [
        \"Royal Rumble confrontation\",
        \"Elimination Chamber match\",
        \"WrestleMania title match\"
      ],
      \"status\": \"active\"
    }"
  }'
```

### Reading Canon Files

```bash
# List all canon files
curl http://localhost:8080/api/canon/files

# Read specific file
curl http://localhost:8080/api/canon/files/rhea_ripley.json
```

---

## üí¨ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Storyline Request

**User Input in Custom GPT:**
```
Help me book a storyline between Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair for the Women's World Championship leading to WrestleMania.
```

**Expected Workflow:**
1. Custom GPT calls `/api/ask` with the request
2. ARCANOS processes with RAG and HRC
3. Checks canon files for current status
4. Returns structured booking plan
5. Optionally stores key decisions in memory

### Example 2: Character Development

**User Input:**
```
I need to turn Cody Rhodes heel after his championship run. What's the best way to do this while maintaining storyline integrity?
```

**Workflow:**
1. Retrieves current Cody Rhodes canon status
2. Analyzes fan psychology and booking patterns
3. Suggests heel turn scenarios
4. Updates canon files with new alignment
5. Plans follow-up storylines

### Example 3: Canon Checking

**User Input:**
```
What's the current status of all championship titles across RAW and SmackDown?
```

**Workflow:**
1. Calls `/api/canon/files` to list files
2. Reads title-related canon files
3. Compiles current championship status
4. Returns organized summary

### Example 4: Memory Storage

**User Input:**
```
Pin this decision: Roman Reigns retains at Crown Jewel, Cody Rhodes gets heel turn angle the next night on RAW.
```

**Workflow:**
1. Calls `/api/memory` to store the decision
2. Tags as booking decision
3. Associates with relevant storylines
4. Confirms storage for future reference

---

## üîç Testing & Verification

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "..."}

# Test API status
curl http://localhost:8080/api
# Expected: Welcome message with model status
```

### Test Custom GPT Integration

1. **Open your Custom GPT**
2. **Test basic functionality:**
   ```
   What's the current worker status?
   ```
3. **Test canon management:**
   ```
   List all available canon files.
   ```
4. **Test memory storage:**
   ```
   Remember this: Test booking session started on [current date].
   ```

### Verify API Responses

```bash
# Test ARCANOS endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Help me plan a basic storyline", "domain": "booking"}'

# Test memory endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/memory \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "Test memory entry for backstage booker"}'

# Test canon listing
curl http://localhost:8080/api/canon/files
```

### End-to-End Workflow Test

1. **Create a test canon file**
2. **Use Custom GPT to read it**
3. **Modify the storyline through GPT**
4. **Verify changes are saved**
5. **Check memory storage**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Custom GPT Actions Not Working

**Symptoms:** Actions fail or return errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify your deployment URL is correct in the action configuration
- Check that your backend is accessible from the internet
- Ensure OpenAI API key is properly configured
- Test endpoints manually with curl first

#### 2. Canon Files Not Accessible

**Symptoms:** Cannot read/write canon files
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if canon directory exists
ls -la storage/canon/

# Create directory if missing
mkdir -p storage/canon

# Check permissions
chmod 755 storage/canon
```

#### 3. Memory Storage Issues

**Symptoms:** Memory not persisting between sessions
**Solutions:**
- Verify storage directory permissions
- Check session configuration
- Ensure sufficient disk space

#### 4. OpenAI API Errors

**Symptoms:** AI responses fail or return errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment
- Check API key permissions and quota
- Test with basic model before fine-tuned model
- Review OpenAI API status

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check environment variables
env | grep OPENAI

# Test API key validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# Check application logs
npm start 2>&1 | tee app.log

# Test specific endpoints
npm run test  # If test scripts are available
```

### Performance Issues

#### High Memory Usage
- Monitor with: `docker stats` (if using Docker)
- Adjust heap size in package.json if needed
- Check for memory leaks in long-running sessions

#### Slow Response Times
- Verify OpenAI API response times
- Check network connectivity
- Monitor server resources
- Consider caching frequently accessed canon files
