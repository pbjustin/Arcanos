# Worker Activation Patch

This patch implements a force worker activation system for the Arcanos backend. It provides a unified interface for initializing and managing different types of workers.

## Files Added

### `/src/services/init.ts`
A service module that provides the `initializeWorker` function for starting workers. It handles:
- `goalTracker` - Goal tracking and analysis worker
- `maintenanceScheduler` - System maintenance scheduling worker  
- `emailDispatcher` - Email sending and management worker
- `auditProcessor` - Security and compliance audit worker

### `/force-worker-activation.ts`
The main patch file that demonstrates the force worker activation pattern. It:
- Imports the `initializeWorker` function from the init service
- Iterates through the 4 core workers
- Uses async/await for proper initialization
- Includes comprehensive error handling

### `/test-worker-init.ts`
A comprehensive test script that validates the worker initialization functionality.

## Usage

### Basic Usage (as shown in problem statement)
```typescript
// Patch: Force Worker Activation & Module Init
import { initializeWorker } from './src/services/init';

const workers = ['goalTracker', 'maintenanceScheduler', 'emailDispatcher', 'auditProcessor'];

workers.forEach(async (worker) => {
  try {
    await initializeWorker(worker);
    console.log(`✅ ${worker} started successfully`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`❌ Failed to start ${worker}:`, err);
  }
});
```

### Running the Patch
```bash
# Set required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Run the patch
npx ts-node force-worker-activation.ts
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test worker initialization functionality
npx ts-node test-worker-init.ts
```

## Features

- **Unified Interface**: Single function to initialize any worker type
- **Dynamic Imports**: Workers are loaded only when needed, reducing startup overhead
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging
- **State Tracking**: Prevents duplicate initialization of workers
- **Resilient Design**: Gracefully handles missing dependencies
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Worker Types

1. **goalTracker**: Tracks and analyzes user goals using AI
2. **maintenanceScheduler**: Schedules and runs system maintenance tasks
3. **emailDispatcher**: Handles email generation and sending
4. **auditProcessor**: Performs security and compliance audits

## Environment Requirements

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for workers that use AI services
- `NODE_ENV`: Optional, defaults to development

## Integration

The patch integrates seamlessly with the existing Arcanos worker system and can be used alongside the existing worker initialization code in `/src/worker-init.ts`.
