# Pass 5: Commit Proposal

## Title

Mark historical audit/refactoring docs and update DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md

## Body

### Why
Previous audit and refactoring summary documents needed to be clearly marked as historical to avoid confusion with current status. DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md needed update to reflect current audit.

### What
- Added historical document headers to 4 audit/refactoring summary files
- Updated docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md with current audit date (2026-01-30) and Pass 1-5 summaries
- Added "Historical Audit Documents" section referencing marked files

### Evidence
- DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md dates from 2026-01-14 (previous audit)
- REFACTORING_* files document completed refactoring work
- Current audit date is 2026-01-30

### Risk
**Low** - Documentation-only changes. Historical documents preserved with clear marking.

### Files Changed
- 5 files updated (1 status doc, 4 historical docs marked)
