# Research Module Documentation

## Overview

The Research Module provides deep multi-source research capabilities by fetching content from multiple URLs, summarizing each source using GPT-4, and synthesizing an overall research insight. This module extends ARCANOS's AI capabilities to perform comprehensive research analysis.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Research**: Fetch and analyze content from multiple URLs
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses GPT-4 to summarize each source
- **Intelligent Synthesis**: Combines all sources into a cohesive research brief
- **Memory Storage**: Stores research data in structured memory format
- **REST API**: Accessible via HTTP endpoint
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failed URLs and network issues

## API Usage

### Endpoint: `POST /commands/research`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "topic": "machine learning fundamentals",
  "urls": [
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning",
    "https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning",
    "https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "topic": "machine learning fundamentals",
  "insight": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed...",
  "sourcesProcessed": 3
}
```

## Programming Interface

### Function: `researchTopic(topic, urls)`

```typescript
import { researchTopic } from './src/modules/research';

const insight = await researchTopic(
  'artificial intelligence ethics',
  [
    'https://www.nature.com/articles/ai-ethics',
    'https://www.brookings.edu/research/algorithmic-bias'
  ]
);
```

**Parameters:**
- `topic` (string): The research topic
- `urls` (string[]): Array of URLs to research

**Returns:** Promise<string> - The synthesized research insight

## Memory Structure

The module stores research data in a structured format:

```
memory/
├── research/
│   └── {topic}/
│       ├── summary              # Final synthesized insight
│       └── sources/
│           ├── 1                # First source summary
│           ├── 2                # Second source summary
│           └── ...              # Additional sources
```

### Memory Content Format

**Summary (`research/{topic}/summary`):**
```json
{
  "topic": "machine learning fundamentals",
  "insight": "Comprehensive research brief...",
  "sources": 3
}
```

**Source (`research/{topic}/sources/{index}`):**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "content": "Summary of the article content..."
}
```

## Error Handling

The module handles various error scenarios:

- **Invalid URLs**: Skips URLs that cannot be fetched
- **Network Failures**: Continues with available sources
- **Content Type Issues**: Only processes HTML content
- **Empty URL Arrays**: Provides synthesis based on topic alone
- **API Failures**: Graceful fallback in test environments

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
npx ts-node tests/test-research.ts
```

View usage examples:

```bash
npx ts-node examples/research-example.ts
```

## Configuration

The module requires:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Access to the ARCANOS memory service
- Network connectivity for URL fetching

In test environments, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `test_key_for_mocking` to enable mock responses.

## Integration

The research module is integrated into the ARCANOS system as:

1. **Express Router**: Available at `/commands/research`
2. **Memory Service**: Uses existing memory infrastructure
3. **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages centralized OpenAI client
4. **Error Handling**: Follows ARCANOS error handling patterns

## Performance Considerations

- URLs are processed sequentially to avoid overwhelming target servers
- Content is limited to first 3000 characters to manage API costs
- Failed URL fetches are logged but don't stop the research process
- Memory storage is optimized for retrieval and analysis
