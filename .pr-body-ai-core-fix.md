## Summary
Fixes "AI core services down" / unreachable AI when backend is up.

## Root cause
- `init-openai` sets only the **adapter** singleton.
- Health/readiness used `validateClientHealth()`, which checks the **unified client** singleton (`singletonClient` in `unifiedClient.ts`).
- The unified client is only set when `getOrCreateClient()` runs; init-openai never calls it, so health always reported "client not initialized."

## Changes
1. **`src/adapters/openai.adapter.ts`** – Added `isOpenAIAdapterInitialized()` so health can check the adapter singleton without throwing.
2. **`src/services/openai.ts`** (`getOpenAIServiceHealth`) – Treat adapter as source of truth for `client.initialized` and `apiKey.configured` (fixes GET /status and GET /health from status router).
3. **`src/utils/health/unifiedHealth.ts`** (`checkOpenAIHealth`) – Treat adapter as source of truth for `healthy` (fixes GET /readyz and health router GET /health).

When the adapter is initialized, /health, /readyz, and /status now report the AI core as ready.
