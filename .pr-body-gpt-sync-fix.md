Fixes GPT sync failing with "OpenAI client not available - API key required" when an API key is set.

**Changes:**
- **credentialProvider**: Do not cache a null key so env is re-checked on each resolution (handles late .env load or deployment vars).
- **unifiedClient**: Retry client creation when a key becomes available after a failed init (e.g. key set in platform after first run).
- **gptSyncMessages**: Error message now lists supported env vars (OPENAI_API_KEY, RAILWAY_OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) and hints to set them in Railway/Docker dashboard, not only in .env.
