Fixes "AI core services down" / unreachable AI when backend is up.

**1. OpenAI adapter (init-openai.ts)**
- Use unified config (`getConfig()`) so OPENAI_API_KEY, RAILWAY_OPENAI_API_KEY, API_KEY, OPENAI_KEY are all respected for the adapter (previously only config.ai.apiKey = OPENAI_API_KEY was used).
- Set the module singleton via `getOpenAIAdapter(adapterConfig)` at init so `getOpenAIAdapter()` (no args) returns the same instance; previously only app.locals was set and the singleton stayed null.
- Call `resetOpenAIAdapter()` when no key so state is consistent.

**2. Readiness (healthChecks.ts)**
- AI readiness now requires API key configured, client initialized, and circuit breaker healthy (not just circuit breaker). Previously only circuit breaker was checked, so "AI ready" could be reported with no API key.
