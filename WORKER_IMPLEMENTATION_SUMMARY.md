# ARCANOS OpenAI Worker System - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ GOAL ACHIEVED
âœ… Successfully activated all OpenAI SDKâ€“compliant AI workers from the GitHub repository.

## ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### 1. Worker Discovery & Auto-Launch âœ…
- **Scanned `/workers/` directory** for all `.js` files using OpenAI SDK
- **Auto-discovery algorithm** detects files containing:
  - `import OpenAI` or `from 'openai'`
  - `chat.completions.create` method calls
- **Found and activated 6 workers**: memorySync, goalWatcher, auditProcessor, maintenanceScheduler, clearTemp, codeImprovement

### 2. Process Management âœ…
- **Used `child_process.fork()`** for Node.js-only worker processes
- **Environment injection**: OPENAI_API_KEY and AI_MODEL automatically passed to workers
- **Startup logging**: Each worker logs "âœ… [worker] running with model: [AI_MODEL]"

### 3. Monitoring & Status âœ…
- **`/workers/status` endpoint** provides real-time worker status:
  - Active workers list
  - Last run timestamps  
  - Uptime tracking
  - Error reporting
- **`/workers/logs/:workerId`** endpoint for worker-specific logs

### 4. Auto-Restart & Reliability âœ…
- **Automatic restart** for failed workers (up to 3 attempts)
- **5-second delay** between restart attempts
- **Process monitoring** with exit code and signal handling

### 5. Memory & Logging âœ…
- **Session logging** to `/var/arc/log/session.log` (production) or `./memory/session.log` (development)
- **Activity piping** - all worker results logged to memory system
- **Comprehensive logging** of worker lifecycle events

### 6. Management APIs âœ…
- **`POST /workers/restart/:workerId`** - Restart specific worker
- **`POST /workers/restart-all`** - Restart all workers
- **`GET /workers/logs/:workerId`** - View worker logs

### 7. Boot Script âœ…
- **`node tools/start-workers.js`** - Standalone worker management
- **Independent operation** - can run workers separately from main server
- **Status monitoring** with periodic updates

## ðŸ“¦ BONUS FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### âœ… Auto-Restart for Failed Workers
- Workers automatically restart on failure
- Maximum 3 restart attempts per worker
- Exponential backoff with 5-second delay

### âœ… Memory Activity Logging
- All task results piped to session.log
- Structured logging with timestamps and worker IDs
- Environment-aware log paths (dev vs production)

### âœ… Boot Script
- `tools/start-workers.js` for independent worker management
- Complete worker lifecycle management
- Graceful shutdown handling

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT STATUS

**Workers Active**: 6/6 âœ…
- auditProcessor - System audit processing
- clearTemp - Temporary file cleanup  
- codeImprovement - Code analysis and suggestions
- goalWatcher - Goal monitoring and tracking
- maintenanceScheduler - System maintenance planning
- memorySync - Memory synchronization tasks

**Current AI Model**: `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal:arcanos-v2:BxRSDrhH`
**Memory Path**: `./memory/session.log` (development)
**Auto-Restart**: Active (3 attempts max)

## ðŸ”— API ENDPOINTS

- **GET /workers/status** - Worker monitoring dashboard
- **POST /workers/restart/:workerId** - Individual worker restart
- **POST /workers/restart-all** - Bulk worker restart  
- **GET /workers/logs/:workerId** - Worker-specific logs
- **GET /health** - Overall system health (includes worker count)

## âœ… ALL REQUIREMENTS SATISFIED

1. âœ… Scan /workers/ for all .js files using OpenAI SDK
2. âœ… Auto-launch each worker using `child_process.fork()`
3. âœ… Inject current OPENAI_API_KEY and AI_MODEL into worker process
4. âœ… Log each worker's load status: "âœ… [worker] running with model: [AI_MODEL]"
5. âœ… Set up /workers/status route with active workers, timestamps, logs/errors
6. âœ… Implement auto-restart for failed workers
7. âœ… Pipe memory activity into session.log
8. âœ… Add boot script: `node tools/start-workers.js`

**All OpenAI SDK-compliant workers are now online and connected to the current AI model and kernel memory system.**
